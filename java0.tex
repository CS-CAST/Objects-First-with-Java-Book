  The purpose of learning computer science, especially here at the high school level, is not to memorize syntax. Rather, we are working to develop approaches to solving problems. Some of the best tools that we have to solve problems are programming languages.\par
  Almost all programming languages help solve problems. Some languages are better suited to specific problems than other languages. There are many elements of a programming language that help solve problems. These elements can include built-in commands, data types, as well as the structure of the language itself.\par
